# Covid-19-Patients-Detection
Corona Virus Detection Using Chest X-ray
This project is a comparison of two pre-trained CNN models for multiclass image classification 
and proposes a new model to improve the performance of the best pre-trained model. The dataset 
used is the Chest X-ray dataset from Kaggle, which contains X-rays of healthy patients, patients 
with pneumonia, and patients with Covid-19.
